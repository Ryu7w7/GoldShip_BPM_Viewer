## Requirements

- [StreamCompanion](https://github.com/Piotrekol/StreamCompanion) running locally
- Python 3.10+ (only if running the script)
- Python libraries:
  - pygame
  - Pillow
  - websockets

No Python needed if you use the compiled `.exe`.

## How to Run

### Run with Python

```bash
pip install pygame pillow websockets
python goldship_dance.py
```
### Run with Release

```bash
To run:
- Download GoldShip_BPM_Viewer.exe

⚠️ Note:
Windows Defender or some antivirus software may flag the EXE as unknown or unsafe because it’s unsigned. This is a false positive—the app is safe.
